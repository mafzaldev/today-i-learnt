# Today I Learnt

## 28-02-2024 (Manifest Chaos)
Today I learnt the structure of `AndroidManifest.xml`, which is a file in Android application, crucial for defining essential information such as package name, permissions, and components like activities and services. It specifies permissions required for accessing device features and declares intent filters for handling various types of intents.

I was working a Flutter project, where I needed to integrate 'Access Phone's internal storage" functionality. I used package from `pub.dev` and copy pasted without thinking too much(silly me ðŸ˜…) the following snippet in `AndroidManifest.xml` 

```xml
<application android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"></application>
```

After adding this, the app was working fine debug mode, but when I built the release apk, it started to crash. On this day, I learnt that, there is always one `<application>` tag, in `AndroidManifest.xml` file. It took me alwmost 2 to 3 days along with a colleague, to debug this error. But, it was great learning experience, and I would never make this mistake in my whole life lol.
